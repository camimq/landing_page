# A Simple Langind Page

A simple landing page project, built with HTML and CSS and inspired by the work of [Rafa Ballerini](https://github.com/rafaballerini).

## The Project

This is a tutorial to exercise some of my front-end skills, which have been idle for so long. 😊

This tutorial was taken from [Rafa Ballerini’s YouTube Channel](https://youtu.be/Lx_YsoMgP40?si=2wQZWpU9EWNEbZf5).

Based on what Rafa Ballerini shared, I created a page with my own tweaks. 😄

🌐 When I finished this tutorial, I made the result available on the web by deploying it on Vercel.
